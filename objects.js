//example of an object. Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, 
you access the data in objects through what are called properties.



var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

//name legs tails and friends are all PROPERTIES
